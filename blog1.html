      <h2>Our Origins</h2>
      <p>
        When I look back at the journey of <strong>SHIKSHA SETU</strong>, I am reminded of a simple but powerful idea — that education is not just a right, but a bridge. A bridge to opportunities, to empowerment, and to a better future.
      </p>
      <p>
        The seed for SHIKSHA SETU was sown years ago during a visit to a rural village on the outskirts of my hometown. I met children full of potential — curious, bright-eyed, and full of questions — but without access to even the most basic education. Their dreams were vivid, but their reality offered little to no support. That experience changed me forever.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        At SHIKSHA SETU, our mission is simple yet profound:
        To <strong>educate underprivileged children</strong>, empower them with knowledge, and enable them to build a better future for themselves and their communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that education is the most powerful tool to break the cycle of poverty. Through our grassroots efforts — from running learning centers to distributing school supplies, offering mentorship, and supporting digital literacy — we strive to create an environment where every child, regardless of their socio-economic background, can learn and grow.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>
        Our vision is to <strong>build a future where no child is denied the right to education</strong> simply because of where they were born. We dream of a society where every child has the tools and support they need to fulfill their potential — where education opens doors instead of closing them.
      </p>
      <p>
        We envision SHIKSHA SETU as a movement — one that not only teaches children to read and write, but also teaches them to believe in themselves.
      </p>

      <h2>A Personal Journey</h2>
      <p>
        Starting SHIKSHA SETU has been one of the most humbling and rewarding journeys of my life. The smiles on the faces of children who attend their first class, the excitement in their voices when they learn something new — these moments remind me why we began.
      </p>
      <p>
        To all those who have supported us — volunteers, donors, partners, and well-wishers — thank you for believing in this vision. And to every child we work with: <em>You are the reason we exist. Your dreams are valid, and we are here to help you reach them.</em>
      </p>
